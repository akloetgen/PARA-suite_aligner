PAr-CLIP Read MApper. Based on the implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and extends it with the use of an empirical error profile.

# Installation
	git clone https://github.com/akloetgen/PARMA.git
	cd PARMA
	make
	
For an easy use of the PARMA algorithm we recommend the additional download of the PARMA toolkit, wrapping the PARMA algorithm into a best-practice pipeline for read mapping (https://github.com/akloetgen/PARMA_tk)
